Still tweaking but it's basically 4x of disciple, roast, anger, anticipate, steam augury, dissolve, jace's ingenuity, clash of wills, an ugin, a nonzero number of disdainful strokes. Aggro isn't common so burn, as well as negates/annuls are in the side. I'm wondering if one or two annuls should be main with the ensoul decks around here.... Land base is what you'd expect, reefs, mountains, islands, temple of epiphany's, the RU life gain land. Since it's all instants or sorceries, your whole deck enables disciple's counter, which itself cannot be countered. Dig/Cruise are kind of redundant since you don't want to be delving away activations. Disciple also counters Ugin and other control finishers nicely, so you're favoured in the control mirror. If creatures slip through the cracks you can tap them down indefinitely and eventually win w/ disciple. You never run out of gas since you get to use all your cards twice, and since you have so much draw, you don't see many games without disciple. Tormenting voice is something I'm experimenting with as well. Perilous vault is likely reasonable as well.
